<h3>About This Site</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>Radish ASMR Lore Archive</strong> is a fan-made effort to catalog, analyze, and preserve the surreal and often unsettling world of Radish ASMR. 
  What started as a niche ASMR channel has grown into a labyrinth of hidden messages, strange ciphers, and emotional themes â€” and this site exists 
  to help make sense of it all.

  I created this archive because I found myself fascinated and absolutely captivated by the deeper narrative beneath the surface. It was so new to me, so strange â€” 
  it made for a storytelling narrative that I never thought was even possible before. To put it bluntly... I am obsessed with Radish ASMR.

<p>
  This site is still a work in progress, and is actually my first time making anything like it... so contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help out â€” whether by writing summaries, offering opinions on what you would like to see on the website, organizing timelines, or 
  offering your own theories â€” feel free to fork the GitHub repo and push any changes you make or message me directly.
